# XNEngine (XeNoEngine)

**This project is for learning, practice and experiment.**

## Overview

XNEngine is designed to provide a robust and flexible platform for the development of interactive 3D games. It is entirely written in C and leverages the power of the OpenGL library for graphical rendering. But support for other rendering tools, such as DirectX or Vulkan, is currently under development.

The use of OpenGL facilitates the creation of high-quality 3D graphics. The engine handles the rendering pipeline, shaders, textures, and 3D models.

## XNE's Tools 
XNEngine comes with development tools :
- [XNE Assets](tools/xne-tools-assets/)
<br>XNE Assets is a tool used for converting 3d file formats (such as ```.fbx```, ```.dae```or ```.obj```) into a custom format that can be loaded into XNEngine.
