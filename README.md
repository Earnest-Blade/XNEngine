# XNEngine (XeNoEngine)

## Overview

XNEngine is designed to provide a robust and flexible platform for the development of interactive 3D games. It is entirely written in C and C++ and leverages the power of the OpenGL library for graphical rendering. But support for other rendering tools, such as DirectX or Vulkan, is currently under development.

The use of OpenGL facilitates the creation of high-quality 3D graphics. The engine handles the rendering pipeline, shaders, textures, and 3D models. It supports advanced techniques such as shadows, lighting effects, and normal maps for an immersive visual experience.

## XNE's Tools 
XNEngine comes with development tools :
- [XNE Model Converter](tools/xne.model/README.md)
<br>XNE Model Converter is a tool that allows you to transform various formats (such as ```.fbx```, ```.dae```or ```.obj```) into a single format that can be loaded into XNEngine.
